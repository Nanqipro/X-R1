We initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening parentheses.\n2. We create a dictionary `parentheses_map` that maps closing parentheses to their corresponding opening parentheses.\n3. We iterate through each character in the input string `s`.\n4. If the character is an opening parenthesis (i.e., one of the values in `parentheses_map`), we push it onto the stack.\n5. If the character is a closing parenthesis, we check whether the stack is empty or not. If it is empty, we immediately return `False` because there is no opening parenthesis to match the closing parenthesis. If the stack is not empty, we pop the top element from the stack and check whether it matches the corresponding opening parenthesis. If they do not match, we return `False`.\n6. If the character is neither an opening nor a closing parenthesis, we return `False` because it is invalid.\n7. Finally, after iterating through all characters, if the stack is empty, we return `True` because all parentheses have been matched correctly. Otherwise, we return `False`."

If the result is non-zero, it increments the `count` variable. Then, it right shifts the input number `n` by 1 bit to move to the next bit. The process continues until all bits of the input number `n` are processed. Finally, it returns the total count of set bits.",

          "To implement the `hamming_weight` function based on the provided description and examples, we need to count the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of the given integer `n`. This can be done by repeatedly performing bitwise AND operation with `n` and `n-1`, which will clear the least significant bit that is set to '1', until `n` becomes zero. The number of operations performed will be equal to the number of set bits in `n`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef hamming_weight(n: int) -> int:\n    count = 0\n    while n:\n        n &= n - 1\n        count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We initialize a counter `count` to zero. This will keep track of the number of set bits.\n- **Loop**: We enter a loop that continues as long as `n` is not zero.\n- **Bitwise Operation**: Inside the loop, we perform a bitwise AND operation between `n` and `n-1`. This operation clears the least significant bit that is set to '1'. For example, if `n` is 11 (binary 1011), then `n-1` would be 10 (binary 1010). Performing the bitwise AND operation (`n & (n-1)`) results in 10 (binary 1010), effectively removing the rightmost '1'.\n- **Increment Counter**: After each operation, we increment the `count` by one because we have found a set bit.\n- **Return Result**: Once `n` becomes zero (which happens when there are no more set bits), the loop exits, and the final value of `count` is returned.\n\nThis implementation efficiently counts the number of set bits in the binary representation of the input integer `n`."

It then initializes `result` to 1, and enters a loop that iterates as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration of the loop, it checks whether `n` is odd, and if it is, it multiplies `result` by `x`. It then squares `x` and divides `n` by 2. This process continues until `n` is no longer greater than 0, at which point it returns `result`."

If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible \n    order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).\n        - For example, the next permutation of arr = [1, 2, 3] is [1, 3, 2].\n        - Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2, 3, 1] is [3, 1, 2].\n        - While the next permutation of arr = [3, 2, 1] is [1, 2, 3] because [3, 2, 1] does not have a lexicographical \n        larger rearrangement.\n    \n    Example 1:\n        Input: nums = [1, 2, 3]\n        Output: [1, 3, 2]\n    \n    Example 2:\n        Input: nums = [3, 2, 1]\n        Output: [1, 2, 3]\n    \n    Example 3:\n        Input: nums = [1, 1, 5]\n        Output: [1, 5, 1]\n    \n    Constraints:\n        1 <= nums.length <= 100\n        0 <= nums[i] <= 100\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find the first decreasing element from the end\n    i = len(nums) - 2\n    while i >= 0 and nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]:\n        i -= 1\n    \n    # If we haven't found any decreasing element, return the reversed array\n    if i < 0:\n        return nums[::-1]\n    \n    # Find the first element greater than the decreasing element\n    j = len(nums) - 1\n    while j > i and nums[j] <= nums[i]:\n        j -= 1\n    \n    # Swap the elements\n    nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]\n    \n    # Reverse the elements after the decreasing element\n    nums[i + 1:] = nums[i + 1:][::-1]\n    \n    return nums",

        "content": "\n\nAnswer: C\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of work required to complete the project and then calculate how long it will take for the two teams to complete that work.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much work each team can do per day:\n\n- Team A: 1/12 of the work per day\n- Team B: 1/18 of the work per day\n\nCombined, they would normally complete 1/12 + 1/18 = 5/36 of the work per day.\n\nNow, consider the given information about the work done:\n\n1. They worked together for 3 days and then stopped for 2 days due to rain.\n   - Work done in 3 days: (5/36) * 3 = 5/12\n   - Work remaining: 1 - 5/12 = 7/12\n\n2. After resuming work, Team A increased its productivity by 50%, so it now completes 6/12 of the work per day.\n   - Team B's productivity remained the same at 1/18 of the work per day.\n   - Combined productivity: 6/12 + 1/18 = 11/18 of the work per day.\n\nWith the increased productivity, they need to cover the remaining 7/12 of the work. Let's calculate the number of days required to finish this part of the work:\n\nLet d be the additional number of days needed after resuming work.\n(11/18) * d = 7/12\nd = (7/12) / (11/18)\nd = 7/12 * 18/11\nd = 21/22 ≈ 0.9545 days\n\nSince they can't work in fractions of a day, they would actually need to work for one full day after resuming work.\n\nAdding up all the days:\n\n- Initial 3 days\n- Pause for rain: 2 days\n- Additional day after resuming work\n\nTotal days = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 days\n\nHowever, this calculation doesn't account for the scenario where they might finish the remaining work in fewer than 6 days. Since the combined productivity of both teams increased significantly after Team A's productivity boost, it is likely they could finish the remaining work in a fraction of a day. But since we are asked for the minimum number of days to complete the entire project, which includes the pause for rain and the additional day after resuming work, the answer remains:\n\nAnswer: C) 11 days"

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD. Think step by step before answering.\n\n1. This is a quick quiz on the equations of motion for a particle. We will consider a particle of mass m under the influence of a constant force F. Remember that a constant force is a vector. That means it has a magnitude and a direction. The direction of F is always perpendicular to the direction of the velocity of the particle. Note that the magnitude of the velocity, v, is always positive. That means the dot product of F and v is always negative.\n\nWe are going to consider four cases.\n\nCase 1: F is directed opposite to the velocity of the particle. Case 2: F is directed toward the velocity of the particle. Case 3: F is directed to the right, and the velocity of the particle is directed to the right. Case 4: F is directed to the left, and the velocity of the particle is directed to the left.\n\nWe will have a multiple-choice question. You will be asked to determine the signs of the quantities shown below.\n\nA) Force F is positive\nB) Velocity v is positive\nC) Momentum p is positive\nD) Acceleration a is positive\nE) Kinetic energy K is positive\n\nAnswer: E\n\nAnswer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD. Think step by step before answering.\n\n1. This is a quick quiz on the equations of motion for a particle. We will consider a particle of mass m under the influence of a constant force F. Remember that a constant force is a vector. That means it has a magnitude and a direction. The direction of F is always perpendicular to the direction of the velocity of the particle. Note that the magnitude of the velocity, v, is always positive. That means the dot product of F and v is always negative.\n\nWe are going to consider four cases.\n\nCase 1: F is directed opposite to the velocity of the"
